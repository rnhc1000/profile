                                    Playing into this market for almost 25 years üïµÔ∏è I have been exposed to a myriad of
                                    technologies and for some of them, being a very early adopter.
                                    My first contact with a programming language was Pascal in the university, where I learnt the key concepts of every
                                    programming language, but my first professional job was to deal with Assembler (8085, 8086 and Z-80) and obviously , C language,
                                    building device drivers for mass storage devices
                                    for the x86 platform (yep, XT and AT IBM PCs), having Turbo C and Turbo Assembler, by Herbert Schildt, as my bedside books
                                    to put some light on to those hours coding in C and using inline Assembler üë®‚Äçüíª. Loved it

                                    I jumped into networking market to surf the wave of the Internet at its infancy in the 90s and got the most of that  to
                                    get some Cisco Networking certifications and help to build the infrastructure of onte the biggest systems integration service provider
                                    and from this position I was moved to Web techomlogy üï∏Ô∏è and back to software development using LAMP "framework" (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP)...
