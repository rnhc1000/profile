                                    Playing into this market for almost 25 years üïµÔ∏è I have been exposed to a myriad of
                                    technologies and for some of them, being a very early adopter.
                                    My first contact with a programming language was Pascal in the university, where I learnt the key concepts of any
                                    programming language, but my first professional job was to deal with Assembler (8085, 8086 and Z-80) and C languages,
                                    building device drivers for mass storage devices
                                    for the x86 platform (yep, XT and AT IBM PCs), having Turbo C and Turbo Assembler, by Herbert Schildt, as my bedside books
                                    to put some light on to those hours coding in C and using inline Assembler üë®‚Äçüíª. Loved it üíò ...
